/**
 * Decides whether Cygnus runs with LuckPerms.
 * <p>
 * Minestom has no plugin folder, so LuckPerms is bootstrapped from {@code main} and shipped inside
 * the fat jar. A class path that leaves the loader out - the test class path does exactly that -
 * runs without any permission backend, and {@code PermissionAwarePlayer} then grants every
 * permission instead of failing on {@code LuckPermsProvider.get()}.
 * <p>
 * Detection reads the class path once and caches the answer, so a permission check never pays for
 * it twice.
